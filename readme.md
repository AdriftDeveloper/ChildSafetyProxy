# PH Realtime AI Proxy Blocker

## Overview
PH Realtime AI Proxy Blocker is a proof of concept designed to use artificial intelligence to block NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content in real-time. This project aims to provide an initial layer of protection and filtering, with a long-term goal of detecting and preventing Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) content using advanced AI algorithms.

## Features
- **NSFW Content Blocking:** Real-time detection and blocking of NSFW content.
- **AI-Powered Filtering:** Uses AI models to classify content based on predefined categories, ensuring content is safe for viewing.
- **Long-term Goal:** Detect signs of CSE with future updates to improve safety and security.

## Usage

Once set up, the AI Proxy Blocker will automatically monitor and filter content passing through the proxy. It will identify NSFW content and block it in real-time, providing users with a safer browsing experience without blocking the whole website!
